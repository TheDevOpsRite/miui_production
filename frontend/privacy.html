    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="dateandtime" > date</span>  </p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the MIUI LSA/LSAV Decryptor (the "Service") is provided and how we treat information. The tool is provided by Shiva Sharma from India to help users decrypt their own MIUI backup files for study and recovery purposes.</p>

    <h2>Purpose & Use</h2>
    <p>The Service is intended to help users decrypt their own data and for study-related purposes only. Misuse is strictly prohibited. Users must not use this Service to access or exploit other people's data without explicit authorization. Any misuse or violation of laws and rules is the sole responsibility of the user.</p>

    <h2>No Collection / No Backend Storage</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store user files on a backend. Decryption is performed client-side in the browser whenever possible. We do not share user files with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Communication via Web3Forms</h2>
    <p>We use Web3Forms for communication messages (contact/feedback forms). This is used only to transmit messages and is not used to store user files. No long-term storage of user files is performed on our backend. If you submit a message via the contact form, it is used solely for communication purposes.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, requests, or need help, contact: <a href="mailto:devopsrite@gmail.com">devopsrite@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Responsibility & Misuse</h2>
    <p>By using this Service you agree to use it only for lawful purposes and for your own data. You are fully responsible for compliance with applicable laws when using this Service. The owner, Shivam Sharma, is not responsible for misuse by users and does not accept liability for actions taken by third parties or users that violate rules or law.</p>

    <h2>Third Parties</h2>
    <p>No user data is shared with third parties. Integrations used only for communication (like Web3Forms) are not used to store files or share backups.</p>

    <p class="muted">This policy may be updated from time to time. Use the site for its intended and lawful purpose.</p>
